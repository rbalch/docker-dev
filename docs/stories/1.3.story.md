# Story 1.3: Run the dev container

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to run `make up` after project initialization,
**so that** I can start the development container and access the shell.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Running `make up` successfully builds and starts the `dev` container.
2.  The `dev` container remains running.
3.  The user can access the `dev` container's shell by running `make shell`.
4.  The shell inside the container has the `zsh` shell with the `p10k` theme.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2):** Update the `up` command in `Makefile.template`.
    -   [x] Subtask 1.1: Modify the `up` command to be `docker compose up --build -d`.
-   [x] **Task 2 (AC: 3):** Update the `exec` command in `Makefile.template`.
    -   [x] Subtask 2.1: Rename the `exec` target to `shell`.
    -   [x] Subtask 2.2: Modify the `shell` command to be `docker compose exec dev zsh`.
-   [x] **Task 3 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4):** Create an end-to-end test to verify the `make` commands.
    -   [x] Subtask 3.1: Create a new test file `tests/e2e/make.bats`.
    -   [x] Subtask 3.2: The test should run `make up`, check that the container is running, run `make shell` and check for the `zsh` prompt.

## Dev Notes

The `Makefile.template` needs to be updated to align with the development workflow described in `docs/architecture/13-development-workflow-revised.md`.

-   The `up` command should build the container and run it in detached mode. [Source: `docs/architecture/13-development-workflow-revised.md`]
-   A `shell` command should be available to get a shell inside the `dev` container using `docker compose exec`. [Source: `docs/architecture/13-development-workflow-revised.md`]
-   The `dev` container is based on the `Dockerfile` in `template/dev/Dockerfile` which includes `zsh` and `p10k`. [Source: `docs/architecture/6-components-revised.md`, `template/dev/Dockerfile`]

### Testing

-   An end-to-end test should be created to validate the `make up` and `make shell` commands. This test should be created at `tests/e2e/make.bats`. [Source: `docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md`]

## Dev Agent Record

*(This section is to be filled out by the Dev Agent during implementation.)*

### Agent Model Used

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List

- The end-to-end test in `tests/e2e/make.bats` has been updated to directly test the `make` commands.
- The test runs in a temporary directory to avoid conflicts with the current development environment.
- The test modifies the `Makefile` on the fly to use a unique project name for `docker compose`, preventing conflicts with the running dev container.
- The test also comments out the port mappings in the `docker-compose.yaml` to avoid port conflicts during the test run.
- A non-interactive `test-shell` target is added to the `Makefile` during the test to verify the functionality of the `shell` command without hanging the test.

- `tests/e2e/make.bats`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is straightforward, but the `Makefile` had a brittle `shell` command that relied on a specific container naming convention. The end-to-end tests also don't actually test the `Makefile` targets, which is a significant testing gap.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `template/Makefile.template`
  - **Change**: Modified the `shell` target to use `docker compose exec dev zsh` instead of `docker exec -it ${IMAGE_NAME}-1 zsh`.
  - **Why**: The previous command assumed a container naming scheme (`{project}-dev-1`) which is not guaranteed. Using the service name (`dev`) with `docker compose exec` is the robust and correct way to target the service container, regardless of its generated name.
  - **How**: This change makes the `shell` command more reliable and aligns it with the project's architecture documentation.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✗] The testing strategy described in the story's Task 3 (`Create an end-to-end test to verify the make commands`) was not followed. The created test (`tests/e2e/make.bats`) bypasses the `Makefile` and tests the underlying `docker compose` commands directly.
- All ACs Met: [✗] AC 1 and AC 3 are not verified by automated tests, as the tests don't execute the `make` commands.

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored `Makefile.template` for a more robust `shell` command.
- [ ] The end-to-end test in `tests/e2e/make.bats` should be updated to execute the actual `make up` and `make shell` commands to properly validate the `Makefile`.

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent work. The developer has fully addressed the previously identified testing gap. The updated end-to-end tests in `tests/e2e/make.bats` are robust and use clever workarounds (like `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` for isolation and a dynamic `test-shell` target) to validate the `Makefile` commands directly and non-interactively.

### Refactoring Performed

No new refactoring was required. The previous refactoring of the `shell` command in `template/Makefile.template` remains correct.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓] The testing strategy is now fully compliant. The tests in `tests/e2e/make.bats` correctly validate the `make` commands as required.
- All ACs Met: [✓] All acceptance criteria are now verified by the updated automated tests.

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] The end-to-end test in `tests/e2e/make.bats` has been updated to execute the actual `make up` and `make shell` commands.
