# Story 2.2: Implement ADK Scaffolding in Installer

**Status:** Draft

**Story**
**As a** developer setting up a new project,
**I want** the installer to ask about including Google ADK support,
**so that** I can optionally add agent development tools to my environment from the start.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. The interactive installer includes a prompt asking the user if they want to add Google ADK support.
2. The `npx` command accepts an `--adk-setup` flag to enable this non-interactively.
3. If the user agrees (or if the flag is present), the tool copies the entire `template/adk` directory to the root of the generated project.

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [ ] **Task 1: Update Scaffolding Config (AC: 1, 2)**
  - [ ] Modify the `ScaffoldingConfig` interface in `src/types.ts` (or equivalent) to include a new boolean property, e.g., `adkSupport: boolean`. [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-revised.md]
- [ ] **Task 2: Add Interactive Prompt (AC: 1)**
  - [ ] Modify `src/prompts.ts` to add a new `confirm` prompt asking the user if they want to include ADK support. [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture-cli.md]
  - [ ] Ensure the result of this prompt updates the `adkSupport` property in the config object.
- [ ] **Task 3: Add CLI Flag (AC: 2)**
  - [ ] Modify the CLI entry point (`src/index.ts`) to accept an `--adk-setup` flag.
  - [ ] If the flag is present, set the `adkSupport` property in the config object to `true`, bypassing the interactive prompt.
- [ ] **Task 4: Update File Generator (AC: 3)**
  - [ ] Modify the `src/generator.ts` module.
  - [ ] Add logic to conditionally execute based on the `adkSupport` flag in the config.
  - [ ] If `adkSupport` is true, the generator must copy the entire `template/adk` directory to the project root destination (`config.installPath`).
- [ ] **Task 5: Testing (AC: 1, 2, 3)**
  - [ ] Add a unit test for the new prompt in `prompts.ts`. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
  - [ ] Add/update integration tests to verify the `--adk-setup` flag works correctly.
  - [ ] Add/update E2E tests to simulate non-interactive flows, asserting that an `adk/` directory and its contents exist in the generated project root only when requested. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

**Dev Notes**
This story is part of **Epic 2: Foundational ADK Integration & Deployment**.

- **File Locations**:
  - All modifications will be within the `src/` directory, primarily `prompts.ts`, `generator.ts`, and the main CLI entry point.
  - The generator will copy the existing `template/adk` directory to the project root.
  - [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture-cli.md, docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Data Models**:
  - The `ScaffoldingConfig` interface will need to be extended to track the user's choice regarding ADK support. [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-revised.md]
- **Testing**:
  - Per the testing strategy, the new interactive prompt requires a corresponding CLI flag (`--adk-setup`) for testability. This is explicitly included in the AC. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
