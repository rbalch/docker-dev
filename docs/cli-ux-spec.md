## CLI User Experience Specification

### **Phase 1: Initialization**

When the user runs `npx <github-repo-url>`, this is what they'll see.

```text
üëã Welcome to the AI Dev Starter Kit!

I'm going to ask you a couple of questions to set up your project.
Let's get you and your new AI coding partner up and running.

Press Enter to continue...
```

### **Phase 2: Configuration**

This phase covers the interactive questions.

**Prompt 1: Installation Directory**

```text
First, where should I set up your project?
(I'll create this folder if it doesn't exist.)

‚û°Ô∏è  Enter path (default: ./ai-dev-environment): 
```
*   **Interaction:** The user can type a path or just hit Enter to accept the default.

**Prompt 2: Project Type**

```text
Got it. Now, what kind of project is this?
(Use arrow keys to select, Enter to confirm)

  ‚óØ Greenfield (A brand new project, starting from scratch)
‚ùØ ‚óâ Brownfield (An existing project you want to bring into the environment)
```
*   **Interaction:** A classic radio button selection. "Brownfield" is the default.

**Prompt 3: Existing Project Path (Conditional)**

*This prompt only appears if the user selects "Brownfield".*
```text
Okay, a brownfield project. Where is the root folder of your existing application?

‚û°Ô∏è  Enter path to your project: 
```
*   **Interaction:** The user must enter a valid path to their existing code.

**Prompt 4: Import Method (Conditional)**

*This prompt only appears if the user selects "Brownfield".*
```text
And how should I import that code? I can either copy it, which is safer, or move it, which is faster.

(Use arrow keys to select, Enter to confirm)

‚ùØ ‚óâ Copy the code into the new environment (Safer, recommended)
  ‚óØ Move the code into the new environment (Faster, but modifies original location)
```
*   **Interaction:** A radio button selection to choose between copying and moving the project files.

### **Phase 3: Execution & Feedback**

This phase provides clear, step-by-step feedback while the tool works.

```text
Perfect. I've got everything I need. Sit back and relax while I work my magic...

‚úÖ Creating project directory at ./ai-dev-environment
‚úÖ Generating Docker and Makefile configurations...
‚úÖ Copying dev environment assets...
‚úÖ Creating placeholder docs...
‚úÖ Installing core agentic framework with 'npx bmad-method install'...
   (This might take a moment, grabbing the latest and greatest for you.)

```

### **Phase 4: Completion & Handoff (Revised)**

```text
‚ú® All done! Your new AI development environment is ready to go.

Here's what to do next:

1.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    `cd ./ai-dev-environment`

2.  **Build and start the environment:**
    `docker-compose up --build`

3.  **Open a new terminal and jump into the dev container:**
    `docker-compose exec dev zsh`

4.  **Once inside, launch the main CLI to start chatting with your new partner:**
    `gemini-cli`
