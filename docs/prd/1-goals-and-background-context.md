# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Significantly reduce the time required for a developer to set up a fully functional, containerized development environment for any project.
*   Increase the adoption and effective use of approved agentic coding tools and best practices across all development teams.

## Background Context

Setting up a robust, consistent, and efficient development environment is a major bottleneck, especially when integrating AI-driven "agentic" coding practices. This friction manifests as technical inconsistencies, procedural confusion, and a steep learning curve, all of which slow down development and hinder the effective use of AI tools. This PRD outlines the requirements for a solution that directly tackles these challenges.
